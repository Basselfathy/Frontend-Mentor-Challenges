## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I Learned

- I gained a clear understanding of when to use **margin** versus **padding** in CSS.
- I learned how **specificity** plays a crucial role in CSS and affects the application of styles.
- I also became more comfortable with coding and implementing styles in **HTML** and **CSS**.
- The concept of **box-shadow** became very clear, and I also learned how to use **Figma** more efficiently.

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my understanding of layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid to create more complex and responsive designs.
