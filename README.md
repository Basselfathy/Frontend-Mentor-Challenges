## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS (Flexbox)
- Google Fonts (Outfit font family)
- desktop-first design approach

### What I learned

During this project, I learned a lot about using Flexbox for centering elements both vertically and horizontally. I also practiced styling with custom fonts using Google Fonts and ensuring that the design is responsive.

For example, I used `object-fit: cover` to ensure the QR code image is responsive and fits neatly within its container:

```css
.qrcode img {
  width: 288px;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing more complex layout techniques, especially working with Flexbox and Grid. I also aim to improve my skills in optimizing images for the web.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs - Flexbox - This documentation helped me understand Flexbox better.
Google Fonts - I used the Outfit font from Google Fonts to style the text.
